# WELCOME TO DUCK.JS

## What *is* duck.js?

Duck.js is an open-source JavaScript project founded with the sole purpose of rendering a spinning duck onto a screen. But duck.js is much more than just that.

With duck.js's *innovative* command system, there are endless opportunities for different features and small easter eggs that make duck.js **unique**. 

Duck.js is far from done. We are planning to add many, many more features down the line and make duck.js truly an amazing website to visit.



## How can I use duck.js?

You can either simply visit the website [here](//duckspin.herokuapp.com), or fork us right here on GitHub! Duck.js uses the very permissive MIT licence, so feel free to modify it how you like.
